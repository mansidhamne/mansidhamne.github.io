Hi, I'm **Mansi Dhamne**, a final-year Computer Engineering student at Sardar Patel Institute of Technology driven by a core belief: **AI should strengthen human well-being and remain grounded in human needs.**

I'm currently a **Research Intern at IIT Bombay** under [Dr. Preeti Rao]() working on prosodic boundary prediction for child-directed speech systems, and I recently completed a **Research Fellowship at Purdue University** under [Dr. Matthew Ward]() where I designed **Health Persona™**, a multimodal monitoring platform for chronic illness management. My research has been published at **EMNLP 2025** and accepted to **AAAI 2026 workshops**, focusing on robust and interpretable AI for healthcare applications.

My research focuses on building AI systems that remain reliable under the conditions that typically break them. I'm particularly interested in:  
1. Designing multimodal systems that capture the depth of human behavior across contexts  
2. Developing interpretability methods that reveal when and why models become unstable

Previously, I've worked as a **Software Development Engineer Intern** at two startups, and I'm honored to have been recognized as the **IBM Maitreyee 2025 Research Showcase Winner**.
