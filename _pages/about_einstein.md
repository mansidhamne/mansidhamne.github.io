Hi, I'm Mansi Dhamne, a final-year Computer Engineering student at Sardar Patel Institute of Technology with a passion for building AI systems that make a real-world impact. I'm currently a Research Intern at IIT Bombay working on prosodic boundary prediction for child-directed speech systems, and I recently completed a Research Fellowship at Purdue University where I designed Health Persona™—a HIPAA-compliant multimodal monitoring platform for chronic illness management. My research has been published at EMNLP 2025 and accepted to AAAI 2026 workshops, focusing on robust and interpretable AI for healthcare applications.
